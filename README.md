# Elixir2048

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

A CLI implementation of the popular iPhone app (from like 8 years ago) 2048. All you need to do to play is clone the repository and fetch a local copy of it, and ensure you have Erlang and Elixir setup on your local machine.

Once you have a local version of the app, simply navigate to the main directory in your terminal and run

```bash
mix deps.get
```

Then run

```bash
mix escript.build
```

And finally run

```bash
 ./elixir_2048
```
